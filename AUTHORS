The bcrypt hash module comes from crypt_blowfish, originally written
by Solar Designer <solar at openwall.com> and based on algorithms and
ideas by Niels Provos <provos at citi.umich.edu> and David Mazieres
<dm at lcs.mit.edu>.

The MD5, SHA256, and SHA512 hash modules, and the underlying
secure-hash primitives, were originally written by Ulrich Drepper
<drepper at cygnus.com> as part of the GNU C Library.  Other people
may also have contributed to them; our records are incomplete.

The DES hash module was originally FreeSec, written by David Burren
<davidb at werj.com.au> for the NetBSD project, and since extensively
modified by Geoffrey M. Rehmet, Mark R V Murray, and Zack Weinberg.

The extended crypt_* interfaces also originated with crypt_blowfish,
but their implementation in this library has been totally rewritten
since then, mostly by Björn Esser and Zack Weinberg.

The above components were assembled into this library by Thorsten Kukuk
<kukuk at suse.de>, Björn Esser <besser72 at fedoraproject.org>, and
Zack Weinberg <zackw at panix.com>.
