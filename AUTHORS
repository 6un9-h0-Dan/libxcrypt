The bcrypt hash module, the extended crypt_* functions, and the
high-level glue code (crypt.c, crypt-gensalt.c) come from crypt_blowfish,
originally written by Solar Designer <solar at openwall.com> and
based on algorithms and ideas by Niels Provos <provos at citi.umich.edu>
and David Mazieres <dm at lcs.mit.edu>.

The MD5, SHA256, and SHA512 hash modules, and the underlying
secure-hash primitives, were originally written by Ulrich Drepper
<drepper at cygnus.com> as part of the GNU C Library.

The DES hash module was originally FreeSec, written by David Burren
<davidb at werj.com.au> for the NetBSD project, and since extensively
modified by Geoffrey M. Rehmet, Mark R V Murray, and Zack Weinberg.

The work of integration into this standalone library was done by
Thorsten Kukuk <kukuk at suse.de>, Bj√∂rn Esser <besser72 at fedoraproject.org>,
and Zack Weinberg <zackw at panix.com>.
