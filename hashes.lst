# This file is read by genhashes.awk and by the configure script.
#
# It lists, for each supported hash algorithm, the name to be used to
# enable or disable it at configure time, which is also part of the
# name used for the 'crypt_fn' and 'gensalt_fn' entry points to the
# relevant algorithm module; an optional suffix on the name of the
# 'gensalt_fn'; the prefix used to identify the algorithm in hash
# strings; the number of bytes of random data required to generate a
# salt; and a set of flags.  Currently there are three flags: DEFAULT
# means this is the hash to use when no prefix was supplied to
# crypt_gensalt, STRONG means the hash is still considered strong
# enough to use for newly hashed passwords, and GLIBC means the hash
# was historically supported by GNU libc's libcrypt.
#
# Fields are separated by whitespace. Lines beginning with # are
# ignored; # is not otherwise significant.  Multiple flags are
# separated by commas.  A field whose contents are a single colon (:)
# is actually understood as an empty string; colon is used for this
# purpose because it cannot be part of a hash prefix or a C identifier.
#
# Note: All entries with the same name should be consecutive.
#
# Note: crypt() checks prefixes in the order they appear in this file,
# and the first match wins.  Therefore, the empty prefix (traditional
# DES) must be last.
