   This function generates a "failure token" in the output buffer,
   which is guaranteed not to be equal to any valid password hash or
   setting string, nor to the setting(+hash) string that was passed
   in; thus, a subsequent blind attempt to authenticate someone by
   comparing the output to a previously recorded hash string will
   fail, even if that string is itself one of these "failure tokens".

   step.  If the individual algorithm's crypt or gensalt function

   otherwise the token is left intact, and the API functions that
