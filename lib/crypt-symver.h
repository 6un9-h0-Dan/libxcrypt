/* The macros for versioned symbols work differently in this library
   than they do in glibc.  They are mostly auto-generated (see gen-vers.awk),
   and we currently don't support compatibility symbols that need a different
   definition from the default version.

   Each definition of a public symbol should look like this:
   #if INCLUDE_foo
   int foo(arguments)
   {
     body
   }
   SYMVER_foo;
   #endif

   and the macros take care of the rest.  Normally, to call a public
   symbol you do nothing special.  The macro symver_ref() forces
   all uses of a particular name (in the file where it's used) to refer
   to a particular version of a public symbol, e.g. for testing.  */
