/* Fallback definition of a function to erase sensitive data stored in
   memory.  The compiler is prevented from optimizing out calls to
   this function, even if no *conforming* C program could tell whether
   it had been called.

   Prevention is accomplished by giving this function a name the
   compiler does not recognize, isolating it in a file of its own,
   annotating it as never to be inlined, and specifically excluding it
   from link-time optimization (see lib/meson.build).  Its body does
   not need to do anything special.  */
