This is the README for libxcrypt
--------------------------------

This library is a replacement for libcrypt which comes with the
GNU C Library. It should be binary compatible with libcrypt.so.1
in that way, as that programs linked against libcrypt.so.1 should
also work with this library, but programs linked against libxcrypt
don't need to work with libcrypt. You can replace libcrypt with a
symlink to libxcrypt.

The advantage of libxcrypt against libcrypt is, that it supports
blowfish password encryption.
